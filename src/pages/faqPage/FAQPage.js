                  Fughesi Ink wants you to enjoy the feel and fit of the shirts
                  that you purchase, and so with quality in mind we decided to
                  stock two different brands of shirts to accommodate everyone's
                  style and budget!

                  The Concert Tee is your budget option with a more relaxed fit
                  while maintaining a super soft, yet traditional cotton feel.
                  The Unisex Triblend comes in as the more premium shirt with
                  exceptional softness and a tapered fit. This shirt leverages
                  the stretch of polyesther, the traditional comfort of cotton
                  and the smoothness of rayon (synthetic silk).

            The inking process

                <p>
                  Graphics are applied to the shirt using a process called "heat
                  transfer toner" which utilizes a printer with modified toner,
                  as well as a specialized carrier sheet. The carrier sheet with
                  the toner is then pressed at high temperature and pressure to
                  another specialized sheet that contains the adhesive polymer.
                  Once that process takes place and the sheets are separated,
                  the original carrier sheet now contains the polymer and toner
                  combined. This post-processed sheet is now situated on the
                  garment and pressed in the same fashion as the previous step
                  (high temperature and pressure).
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The final step involves a third press with even higher
                  pressure and this is where we have the option to apply one of
                  three different finishing mats which will help seal the ink
                  into the garment while giving either a matte look or a more
                  glossy finish.
